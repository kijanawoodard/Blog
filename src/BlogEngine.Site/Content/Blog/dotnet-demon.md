Sometimes it's the little things.

A while ago, I installed [.net demon] and ran the trial. I was instantly impressed. 

The trial expired during a period when I wasn't coding at home very often. I kind of forgot about it, except for occasionally noticing the trial expiration reminder at the bottom of visual studio. Too many other more pressing things to do...blah blah blah.

As I was working today, I suddenly noticed how often I was pressing ctrl-s (save), ctrl-shift-b (build), alt-tab (switch windows), and F5 (refresh browser).

I went to the .net demon site to purchase my license. 

$30. 

Thirty dollars. I've been expending all those keystrokes to save thirty dollars?

In addition to auto-save and compile, [.net demon] integrates with [live reload] so Chrome auto-refreshes as I code. I just glance at my browser to see changes.

I find I'm using the mouse a lot less as well.

I think I've gotten my money's worth typing up this post. :-]
