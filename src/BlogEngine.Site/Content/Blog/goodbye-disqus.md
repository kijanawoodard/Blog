title: Goodbye Disqus

I've decided to remove disqus comments from my blog.

I had several issues with disqus:

* Long page loads [async aside]
* Threaded comments 
* Time shifting - oldest may not be on top, so a "first!" comment might be in the middle
* Links to other sites
* Injected marketing cookies

What really forced the decision was the nature of comments themselves. Are comments a valuable part of the blog? If so, I should own them. If not, I should turn them off.

On taking ownership, disqus has an export feature. It "works", but it's not ideal. I'll talk about how I dealt with that in a future post. Hint: F#.

At the moment, I've migrated comments to yaml and they are stored in the github repo with posts. I'm looking at options for a friendlier comment system, but in the meantime, send me a pull request. ;-)
