title: Thoughts on Script#

I had an email discussion about [Script#] the other day. I didn’t like it. I admit I looked at the website for less time than it took me to write this post.

After sleeping on it, I figured out what bothers me about it. It reminds me of WebForms – let’s pretend we’re not in a browser.

Better approaches to being uncomfortable working in a browser:

1. Get out of the browser.
2. Get over it.

WPF/Click Once seems like a good choice. jQuery seems like a good choice. Compiling a high level language into a scripting language seems like a recipe for headaches.

  Message: "<p>Ya Im sure it has its limitations (generics..etc) but it seems like a 'nice-to-have' as a side tool in case you want to just lay down a demo ajax web app quickly. True that I wouldnt use it for non-web apps but it having support for all browsers is a big plus (save time moding ajax/js code for browser specifics) Im gonna try it out.. thanks for the link.</p>"
