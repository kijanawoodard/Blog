title: TekPub Rocks!

I finally got around to getting a subscription for [TekPub]. I watched three of the jQuery videos, two of the MVC videos and one Linq video.

The thing is, I use jQuery and Linq all the time. I thought I “knew” these technologies. I’ve watched a slew of the MVC videos on asp.net. I’ve read articles all over the web. I’ve read the docs for these products.

I learned more in these six videos in a day than I had in a year of fumbling around. The problem is that you have a project to get done. With jQuery, things were so much easier than writing raw js, I thought it was great already. I see now that I was missing quite a bit. For Linq, I got the clearest explanation of how we moved from .net 2.0 to 3.5, exactly what lambdas and delegates do and how they are constructed essentially. I was decent at using Linq, but I always found myself struggling to explain it. Now I can say – Goto TekPub.

Rob was already my here because of [SubSonic], now I have TekPub to be thankful for as well.

Thanks Rob and James.
