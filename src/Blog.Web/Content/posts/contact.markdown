  Message: "<p>Hi Kijana, <br>I wanted to discuss domain objects in the context of an SOA architecture. I noticed your recent opinions on of the NServiceBus forum threads, and thought they are a closely aligned to how I view this space. So if you allow me, can I pick your brains in the matter. <br>Essentially I look at my Sagas as domain objects. This is also what Udi said in his ADD course. Thoughts?</p>"
